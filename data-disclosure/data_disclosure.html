<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Amplify Generative AI Use
Policy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Amplify is a versatile and secure
generative ai chat platform built by the Vanderbilt Generative AI team that
enables private access to Large Language Models (LLMs) in a platform agnostic
way, allowing for integration of models from multiple vendors such as
Anthropic, Amazon, and OpenAI. With strict adherence to Vanderbilt’s
cybersecurity standards and data use protocols, Amplify’s key features include
Retrieval Augmented Generation, which allows document-based queries without
repeated uploads, and “Sources &amp; Citation,” which increases transparency by
citing document snippets used in responses, and an interactive custom Assistant
creator. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The platform offers full-context
window access for comprehensive interactions, combining answers from multiple
prompts into one unified response, and supports a range of document formats for
user convenience. Amplify also provides organizational tools such as prompt
templating, conversation sharing within the Vanderbilt community, diagramming,
data visualization, export options, and workspace management to streamline user
experience and enhance productivity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>While Amplify is a powerful tool,
it must be used responsibly. As such, you are expected to read this use policy
carefully and ensure that you fully understand what Amplify can—and cannot—do
for you. In particular, it is imperative that you ensure your use of Amplify
does not unintentionally disclose sensitive and confidential information.
Additionally, keep in mind that Amplify, like all AI tools, may present
erroneous or even illegal responses to your queries. It remains your obligation
to ensure that Amplify is used in a responsible manner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Failure to comply with this use
policy may results in disciplinary, or potentially legal action. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This policy may be updated as Amplify
continues to grow and evolve. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>SCOPE</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This policy governs the use of
Amplify by authorized staff, faculty, students, and researchers (the
“Vanderbilt community”) in the performance of their functions for or on behalf
of Vanderbilt. Because this policy may be updated from time to time, Vanderbilt
community members will be asked to review the most recent version of this
Policy before the start of each fall and spring semester, as well at the start
of the summer break. Any questions regarding this policy can be directed to
amplify@vanderbilt.edu. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>DEFINITIONS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>“Amplify” means the machine-based
tool provided by Vanderbilt to consider user questions, prompts, and other
inputs to generate a human-like output. Amplify may, at Vanderbilt’s
discretion, integrate standalone offerings such as ChatGPT, Bard, or other
platforms. Access to such standalone offerings via Amplify will be arranged by
Vanderbilt on your behalf and to the extent any additional policies or rules
apply to the use of such standalone offerings, those policies and rules will be
provided for your review. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>“Confidential Information” means
any business or technical information or research result belonging to
Vanderbilt, a Vanderbilt community member, collaborators or other third
parties, that is not publicly known or that has been provided or received under
an obligation to maintain the information as confidential. Confidential
Information also includes non-public Personal Information. Please note that at
this time, while Protected Health Information (“PHI”) is confidential
information, PHI should <u>NOT be accessed via Amplify</u>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>“Data Classification Policy”
means Vanderbilt’s Administrative Policy entitled “Data Classification Policy”
defining a categorization of Vanderbilt data and information according to its
level of risk, value, and criticality to the University. (available, <a
href="https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-URL/wp-content/uploads/sites/352/2021/03/19225810/Data-Classification-Policy-05.11.2020.pdf">https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-URL/wp-content/uploads/sites/352/2021/03/19225810/Data-Classification-Policy-05.11.2020.pdf</a>).
A summary of the Data Classification Policy can be found in the Data
classification guidance.  (available, <a
href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/cybersecurity/guidelines/data-classification/">https://www.vanderbilt.edu/cybersecurity/guidelines/data-classification/</a>).
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>“Personal Information” means any
information that, whether alone or in combination with other available
information, identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being
associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an
individual. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>POLICY</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Vanderbilt expects all Vanderbilt
community members to follow these guidelines when using Amplify for teaching
and learning, research, and work-related functions: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>At this time, you may input
information that is classified as Levels 1, 2, or 3 within the Data
Classification Policy, except that PHI and/or HIPAA data may NOT be uploaded to
Amplify. Level 4 data may NOT be uploaded to Amplify. </b>However, if the data
in question is subject to additional confidentiality obligations, such as a
data use agreement with a third party that prohibits use of AI technologies or
attorney-client privilege, such data may not be uploaded to Amplify. For
example, a contract with a third party to access a data set may prohibit you
from uploading that information to an AI system, even thought it would
otherwise only qualify as Level 2 data. Such data may not be uploaded to
Amplify. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>If you are unsure whether where
your data falls within the Data Classification Policy, please seek assistance
by contacting amplify@vanderbilt.edu. Remember that certain data may not be
confidential by itself but may become confidential when combined with other
information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>KEEP IN MIND: Certain sharing
capabilities within Amplify may permit others to access the data you upload to
Amplify. You may not share an instance of Amplify that has access to
Confidential Information with individuals with whom you would not share the
underlying data. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Do not input information that
violates IP or general contract terms and conditions: Vanderbilt community
members must be aware of the terms and conditions under which they are using
Amplify. All members of the Vanderbilt community must respect IP rights.
Moreover, when using Amplify, review outputs carefully to ensure you are
respecting third party rights, such as copyright and patent laws. You are
required to abide by any laws, regulations, publication standards, etc. that
mandate the disclosure of your use of AI tools when incorporating output
generated by Amplify in your work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Additionally, you must take
reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy of Amplify output. The Amplify system
has been intentionally designed to allow users to adjust its performance and
output. Depending on your settings, the risk of “hallucinations” or other
erroneous information may be substantial. Check you work carefully—you are
responsible for any Amplify-generated content you rely on, share, or publish. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In a similar way, check Amplify’s
output for illegal content. Amplify’s responses will be generated based on user
settings, query structure, uploaded data, and other factors that may be beyond
a user’s control. Please be aware of relevant rules and regulations regarding
discrimination, harassment, bias, or other concerning output. Your use of
Amplify remains subjects to Vanderbilt’s standards of conduct (available at <a
href="https://vanderbilt.edu/compliance/files/standards-of-conduct.pdf">https://vanderbilt.edu/compliance/files/standards-of-conduct.pdf</a>),
and the University’s equal opportunity, nondiscrimination, anti-harassment, and
affirmative action policies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Do not use Amplify to produce
malicious content: Vanderbilt community members are prohibited from using
Amplify to generate malicious content, such as malware, viruses, worms, and
trojan horses that may have the ability to circumvent access control measures
put in place by Amplify, or any other third-party entity, to prevent
unauthorized access to their respective networks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>GENERATIVE AI AND RESEARCH</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The policies above apply to all
Vanderbilt research activity. In addition, the following considerations and
policies also extend to all research activity using Amplify:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Follow all policies of journals,
grant funding organizations, or other societies applicable to your research.
Keep in mind that these standards are frequently evolving and what may have
been acceptable conduct is the past may now violate an important condition for
publication. You should strive to follow your field’s best practices when
employing Amplify in your research. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>If you are asked to peer review
the work of others, please be sure you are permitted to use AI tools before
employing Amplify. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Researchers should disclose any
relevant use of Amplify when disclosing inventions or innovations to the Center
for Technology Transfer and Commercialization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Finally, all Vanderbilt research
remains subject to applicable research integrity policies and the faculty
manual.</p>
