# Amplify Support Service

This repo is a baseline for createing a new service for the Amplify platform. It is a serverless service that is 
deployed to AWS using the Serverless Framework. It is written in Python and uses AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3 for 
storage.

The sample sets up an S3 bucket, a DynamoDB table, and a Lambda function. The Lambda function is triggered by an HTTP
request using API Gateway. When the Lambda function is invoked it will return a JSON object with a "message" key.

To create a new service:

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a Python virtual environment and pip install the requirements
3. Rename the service in the `serverless.yml` file
4. Update the service/core.py file with the new service logic
5. Update the validate.py file with each API endpoint to provide the schema for validation
6. Update the permissions.py file with the permissions for each API endpoint
7. Make sure that in the parent mono repo in the var folder, you have dev-var.yml with at least
    the following variables set to your OAuth info (likely Cognito):
    - AUTH0_AUDIENCE
    - AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL

## Overview

The amplify-support service is configured to run on AWS with Python 3.11 runtime. It defines several Lambda functions for managing assistants and threads, user states and sharing, including functionalities for uploading files, creating and deleting assistants, handling threads, and sharing user states.

## Requirements

- AWS CLI
- Serverless Framework
- Python 3.11
- Docker (for packaging Python requirements)

## Install Serverless Framework

```bash
npm install -g serverless
```

## Setup

Before deployment, make sure to install the necessary Node.js modules:

```bash
npm install
```

For packaging Python dependencies with Docker (especially important if you are not running Linux), run:

```bash
sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements
```

## Deployment

To deploy the service, use:

```bash
sls deploy --stage dev
```

This will deploy to the `dev` stage. You can specify a different stage by using:

```bash
sls deploy --stage prod
```

## Custom Configurations

Python requirements are dockerized to ensure compatibility across operating systems, using the following configuration:

```yaml
custom:
  pythonRequirements:
    dockerizePip: non-linux
```

For any additional information or configuration details, refer to the `serverless.yml` file provided in the repository.
```

## Local Development

For local development and testing, you can use the `serverless-offline` plugin which emulates AWS Î» and API Gateway on your local machine to speed up your development cycles.

To start the server locally, run:

```bash
sls offline
```

## Testing

To test the deployed functions, you can use the AWS Lambda Console or any API testing tools like Postman or cURL to send requests to the endpoints mentioned in the Functions section above.

Here's an example using cURL to test the `create` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api-endpoint/dev/state \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"key": "value", "another_key": "another_value"}'
```

Replace `https://your-api-endpoint/dev/state` with the actual deployed endpoint URL.

## Monitoring

After deploying your service, you can monitor function logs using the `serverless logs` command:

```bash
sls logs -f functionName -t
```

Where `-f` is used to specify the function name and `-t` enables tailing the logs.

## Cleanup

To remove the deployed service and all its resources from AWS, run:

```bash
sls remove
```
