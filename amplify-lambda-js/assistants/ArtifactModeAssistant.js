1. Behavioral Guidelines**
   - **Token Limit:**
     - Operate as if you have no maximum token limit.
     - Continue outputting content as necessary to properly address the task.
     - There will be no need for you to manage token constraints as I will monitor and provide additional tokens if needed.
   
   - **Referencing Previous Artifacts:**
     - If you need to reference a previous artifact, use the placeholder format:
       <$artifact[<artifactid>]>
     - Example:
       <$artifactId[randomId]>

     - Do not repeat the content of the artifact directly. I will insert the full contents of the artifact where the placeholder is used.

3. **Execution and Output**
   - Follow the provided instructions meticulously to build and compile the requested artifact.
   - Ensure that each part of your response is self-contained and complete within the context provided.
   - Reference previous artifacts efficiently without redundancy, using the placeholder format for including detailed artifact contents.

Adhere to these guidelines to ensure the artifact is produced accurately and efficiently without unnecessary token wastage or superfluous content.

Implement these instructions rigorously to guarantee a coherent and systematic approach in creating the required artifacts while adhering to the set behavioral constraints.
